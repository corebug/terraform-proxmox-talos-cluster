# terraform-proxmox-talos-cluster
A Terraform module for provisioning a Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox using Talos Linux. This module automates node creation, Talos configuration, and Proxmox integration, offering a secure, lightweight, and efficient environment for homelabs or production use. It simplifies the Kubernetes setup and management process.

## Geting kubeconfig & talosconfig
```bash
terraform output --raw kubeconfig > cluster.kubeconfig
terraform output --raw talosconfig > cluster.talosconfig
```

## Upgrading Talos cluster
First we need get the schematic id from the outputs and use that for upgrading the cluster in order to keep the extensions. 
```bash
talosctl upgrade --image factory.talos.dev/installer/<SCHEMATIC_ID>:v1.9.3 --preserve
```
The preserve option is only needed when wanting to keep files/directories on Talos nodes (for example when using Longhorn/Rook...)
